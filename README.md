# RockPaperScissorsGame

I created this game as part of The Odin Project course

It's a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game

# User input

To get the user inputs I created 3 buttons for each possible play and with JavaScript I assign values to them

# Computer input

For the computer input I used a switch case with a number randomizer from 0 to 2

Each number has it's own value: 0 = 'Rock' , 1 = 'Paper', 2 = 'Scissors'

# Game function

In this function which I called 'winnerSelection', I go through each possible outcome and depending on them I tell the user if he won/tied/lost.

# Technologies

I used pure HTML & CSS since it's a simple page that doesn't need much styling

For the game to run I used JavaScript which is what this project is all about

# Suggestions

Suggestions are always welcome, if you have any please message me or push it here

I'd be more than happy to accept them even if it's just a "little thing"
